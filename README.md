Debian 12 & Window 10 on MacbookPro 5.2 (2009)

You can find a feedback about how I achieve to install dual boot with Debian 12 and Windows 10 on an old Macbook Pro 5.2 17'' (2009), after a lot of fails.

Format your disk with MRB and not GPT, for bios legacy install.

Start by finding a CD/DVD for a bios legacy install of Windows 10. 

Why bios legacy? because of it's the only (simple) way to install the boocamp driver, especially for NVidia 9600M GT (and on chip 9400M) driver using driver. There is a way to install using EFI but it's for experimented users (see there for details ).
